reproduce CorteXlab GNURadio docker task execution concurrency issues
=====================================================================

description
-----------

the shell scripts are to be run in the containers on the node and will
start a "server" in background, then a "client", and perform network
transfer between them

there are four tests:

- iperf (network testing tool) in TCP mode
  
- iperf (network testing tool) in UDP mode
  
- GNURadio UDP in run-to-completion mode
  
- GNURadio UDP in prompt-for-exit mode
  
The GNURadio client/server are two very simple designs:

- server listening with an UDP source block

- client sending with an UDP sink block

Both design output the data stream to a file with a .out extension,
and to stdout.

Some start / stop logs are manually added to the generated .py files

The CorteXlab task scenario is in folder task

Results
-------

Nodes 3 and 4: the iperf tests work perfectly

Nodes 7 and 8: different behavior between "run to completion" or
"prompt for exit" modes:

- node7: client/server in run-to-completion mode: the logs show that
  the client and server both run and exit correctly, and both server
  and client .out files are generated and are of the correct size

- node8: client/server in prompt-for-exit mode: the logs show that
  client and server both run correctly, but both client and server
  .out files are empty

Before adding a throttle block to all flowgraphs, there were issues in
run-to-completion mode: the logs showed that the client and server
both run and exit correctly, but the server output file contained no
data. The explanation (thanks LÃ©o) is that without the throttle block,
and when the threshold of the [head] block is lower than the buffer
size, the [head] block can trigger the stop of the flowgraph *before*
[file sink] sees any data.
